# Schedulizer

Referee scheduling at its finest

## Overview

* Be able to read in games made of team ids
* based on certification level and team membership, calculate which games the ref has free
* based on SOMETHING, assign refs to games and print out a nicely formatted schedule.

## Thoughts
* Look into how ruby does includes - I've got come c++ level trees going on and I'm not sure that's ok.
